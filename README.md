# Ocephes

Bindings to special math functions from the [Cephes](http://www.netlib.org/cephes/) library.

# Note

I've emailed Stephen L. Moshier to ask for permssion to repackage his library
but have not received (as of 2015-08-03) a response. The [readme](http://www.netlib.org/cephes/readme)
grants permission for this code to be used freely, and I've followed the example
of other libraries ([Scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/special/cephes)
and [Torch](https://github.com/deepmind/torch-cephes)) in repackaging Cephes.
To reiterate, all of the `C` code in this repository is Stephen L. Moshier's.
